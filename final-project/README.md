# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Personal Portfolio*

![Personal Portfolio](img/portfolio.jpg)

My goal is to create a personal portfolio that communicates who I am as a designer and a person. I want to convey my design approach, technical and soft skills, and personal interests and values. I will use P5 for features such as Alpha Mask to make my portfolio visually engaging. Additionally, I will make it interactive through project thumbnails that reveal details on hover, marquee animations, custom cursor interactions, and scrolling animations. I’ll make it accessible through clear navigation structure, alt text for images, high contrast color options, and more.

### *Shanghai Family Recipes*

![Shanghai Family Recipes](img/shanghai-recipes.jpg)

I want to create a digital preservation of family recipes from Shanghai to make these recipes accessible and engaging for future generations in my family. I’ll make it interactive through filtering options by ingredient, occasion, or difficulty, and a dynamic service size calculator. To make it accessible, I will ensure screen reader compatibility, clear typography, multiple language support, and clear alt text.

### *Personal Finance Tracker*

![Personal Finance Tracker](img/finance-tracker.jpg)

My goal is to create a customizable financial tracking system that combines spending tracking and categorization, credit card reward optimization, and yearly/monthly overviews in one dashboard. It will be interactive through dynamic spending visualizations, real-time category spending bars, and adding new transactions. I’ll make sure my data tables are accessible, the charts are color-blind friendly, and that there are consistent navigation patterns.

## Feedback Summary

Summarize all the critiques you received during the lab session (\~300 words). 

## Feedback Digestion

Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.
